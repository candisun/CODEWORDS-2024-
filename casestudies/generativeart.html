                Instructional or generative art refers to an art practice in which the artist devises a process or system that guides the creation of the artwork.

            <p class="sans summary justify">This process can take various forms, including a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or another type of procedural mechanism. Once established, the process is set into motion, often with some autonomy, allowing the system to contribute to or even fully generate the final artwork.    
            </p>
            <p class="sans summary">
                The degree of control the artist maintains can vary, but the outcome is often influenced by the process itself, resulting in a piece that reflects both the artistâ€™s intention and the inherent unpredictability or independence of the system used. 
            </p>
            <p class="sans summary">
                Generative art, particularly when driven by algorithms or mechanical systems, highlights the role of chance, variation, and emergent behaviour in the creative process, blending human creativity with computational or procedural forces.

                Yoko Ono's 1964 collection "Grapefruit" is a seminal work in instructional art, pushing the boundaries of artistic creation and audience participation. As I reflect on its impact, I'm struck by how Ono's written instructions transform readers into active creators, blurring the line between artist and audience. 
                <br><br>The anti-consumerist approach of "Grapefruit" resonates deeply with me. By dematerialising art into pure concepts and actions, Ono challenges the commodification of creativity. This radical departure from traditional art forms inspires me to reconsider the essence of artistic expression.
               </p>
            <p>
                What I find particularly compelling is how each instruction in "Grapefruit" explores distinct themes, inviting diverse interpretations and experiences. This multiplicity of meanings within a seemingly simple format showcases Ono's artistic genius. Ono's work has profoundly influenced my understanding of art's potential. It's made me appreciate how art and design can exist beyond physical objects, residing instead in ideas, actions, and shared experiences.

                Sol LeWitt's approach to art fundamentally reshaped my understanding of artistic creation and conceptualisation. His wall drawings, executed based on written instructions, epitomise instructional art. LeWitt's belief that the idea behind the artwork is more important than its physical execution deeply resonates with me.        
            </p>
            <p class="sans summary">I'm inspired by how LeWitt's instructions allow for interpretation and variation in the final product, challenging traditional notions of authorship. His work demonstrates that art can exist primarily as a concept, with the physical manifestation being secondary. 
                <br><br>LeWitt's systematic approach to creating art, using simple forms and colours arranged according to predetermined rules, opened my eyes to the beauty of process-driven creativity. It made me appreciate how constraints can paradoxically lead to greater artistic freedom and innovation.
