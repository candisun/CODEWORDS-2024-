                  <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-text-2">In his 2008 introduction to Ohio State University’s visual poetry collection, Sackner distinguishes between concrete and visual poetry. Concrete poems rely solely on letters and words to create visual images, whereas visual poems integrate both images and text.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>A Calligram, for instance, arranges words in a specific shape related to the text's meaning. In contrast, a Concrete Poem emphasises the physical layout of words and letters, focusing on their placement to create meaning rather than shaping them into a recognisable form. Concrete Poets experiment with spatial relationships, using repetition, fragmentation, and unconventional spacing to generate a visual-verbal interaction.&nbsp;

                  <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> As a late phase of Literary Modernism, Concrete Poetry broke away from the expansive, complex linguistic structures favoured by earlier modernist writers. Instead, it reduced the text to a bare minimum, often using only a few words carefully placed to encapsulate profound ideas or emotions.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>This stark reduction marked a shift in literary experimentation, challenging traditional notions of poetic form. Concrete Poetry holds a unique position among avant-garde literary movements today. Unlike many other experimental forms, it enjoys more popularity outside of academic circles, appealing to a broader audience through its striking visual presentation.

                  <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-text-7"> Concrete Poetry originated in the 1950s, influenced by Concrete Art in Northern Europe and Latin America. It sought to bring the clarity and simplicity of visual&nbsp;art to written language. Many early Concrete Poets were closely tied to Concrete Artists and often borrowed basic visual designs such as grids, spirals, and columns - directly from art pieces to arrange their text.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>This practice of simplifying complex ideas into minimalist forms reflected the modernist ideas seen in the International Style, known as the "architecture of&nbsp;the machine age," which&nbsp;<br>embodied&nbsp;the crystallisation of modernism&nbsp;<br>in building design.

                  <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-2"> Brazilian poet Augusto de Campos played<br>&nbsp;a crucial role in developing and popularising Concrete Poetry, particularly in Latin America. He believed that words should be more than just carriers of meaning; they should also be visual elements that interact with the reader. Through his website and numerous publications, Campos continues to explore new ways to combine visual effects with linguistic content, transforming the text into an integral part of the poem’s visual experience.<br>
                    <br>Augusto de Campos' "Olho por Olho" (1964) is&nbsp;<br>a significant example of Concrete Poetry that challenges both visual perception and reading. The poem creates a multidimensional experience by blending images and text, playing with illusions and offering multiple interpretations. It shifts between self-reference, metalanguage, and critical insight, encouraging readers to engage with its complex structure. The title, derived from&nbsp;<br>a biblical phrase meaning "eye for eye,"&nbsp;<br>hints&nbsp;at&nbsp;a moral or vengeful theme, symbolised by&nbsp;a triangular traffic sign. As the reader&nbsp;approaches the poem, this sign&nbsp;<br>appears to expand, adding a visual layer to its&nbsp;deeper message.<br>

                  <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-3"> Décio Pignatari was a pioneering Brazilian poet, writer, and theorist, best known for his role in the development of Concrete Poetry. Alongside Augusto and Haroldo de Campos, he&nbsp;<br>co-founded the Noigandres group, which was central to the concretist movement in Brazil. Pignatari's work is characterized by its sharp social and political commentary, often critiquing consumerism, advertising, and cultural imperialism.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>His poem Beba Coca-Cola (1957) is a sharp critique of advertising culture. By isolating parts of the Coca-Cola slogan and playing with their meanings—such as "cola" (glue) and "coca" (a stimulant)—Pignatari exposes the insidious power of commercial slogans. The poem’s use of red and white, the colours of Coca-Cola, reinforces its satirical tone, transforming a familiar brand into a critique of addiction and cultural degradation.&nbsp;<br>

Gomringer's approach set the groundwork for Concrete Poetry as a distinct art form, blending linguistic and visual elements.<br>

His work often arranged letters and words in abstract forms, creating visual compositions that invite the reader to interpret meaning not only through language but also through the physical arrangement on the page. Garnier’s spatial poems push the boundaries of traditional verse, making the visual layout as important as the written content.<br>
