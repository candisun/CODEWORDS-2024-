                        <p>Both Filipe Peregrino and Dong Yoon Park have deeply influenced my approach to typography, particularly in how type interacts with space. Peregrino’s work challenges traditional design by using space and movement to transform text into dynamic, multidimensional forms. His approach has made me see typography as more than static visuals—it can be fluid, adaptable, and experiential.
                        </p>
                        <p>Similarly, Dong Yoon Park's exploration of 3D type in virtual and augmented realities has pushed me to think about typography beyond the flat screen. Park treats type as a sculptural element that can exist in immersive environments, inviting user interaction. 
                            <br> <br>Both of these designers have expanded my view on how typography can be manipulated and reshaped in immersive contexts, inspiring me to experiment with type as a flexible and interactive medium. Their influence encourages me to explore how letterforms can engage users in new and creative ways, both physically and digitally.

                        <p>Mark Themann’s work, particularly his exploration<br> of placing type behind objects, has broadened my understanding of where and how text can exist. When I saw his use of typography in 2012, it pushed me to think beyond the conventional mediums like screens, magazines, or books. Instead, it opened my eyes to the raw potential of integrating type directly with physical environments — on walls, behind objects, and even on 
                            <br>concrete surfaces. 
                        </p>
                        <p>This approach challenges the static presentation of words, encouraging a more immersive and tangible interaction with typography. Themann’s work has inspired me to consider how type can interact with its surroundings, prompting me to explore unconventional spaces where letters can be more integrated into our everyday physical world. This has added a new dimension to how I view and work with type, blending the digital and physical in ways that expand creative possibilities.
